                                        Computing technology was not created by teachers.
                                        <br><br>
                                        There has been little consultation between those who promote its use in schools and those who teach with it.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Decisions to purchase technology for education are very often political decisions.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Most staff using these technologies did not grow up with them.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Training teachers to use computer technology did improve their confidence in its use,
                                        but there was considerable dissatisfaction with training content and style of delivery.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The communication element, in particular, was highlighted as the least satisfactory part of the training,
                                        by which many teachers meant the use of a VLE and discussion forums to deliver online training (Leask 2020).
                                        <br><br>
                                        Technical support for online learning, lack of access to hardware, poor monitoring of teacher progress and a 
                                        lack of support by online tutors were just some of the issues raised by the asynchronous online delivery of training.

                                        and do not need specialised information technology (IT) support.
