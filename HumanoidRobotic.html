                        <p>
                            <br><br>The AI for Good Global Summit, first held in 2017, will return to Geneva on July 6 and 7 after a three-year COVID-imposed break, the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU) said.
                            The event will aim to showcase how artificial intelligence and other new technologies can help reach the UN's so-called sustainable development goals (SDGs), including on fighting climate change and boosting humanitarian action.
                            "It's in our collective interest that we can shape AI faster than it is shaping us," the ITU's new chief Doreen Bogdan-Martin said in a statement.
                            "This summit, as the UN's primary platform for AI, will bring to the table leading voices representing a diversity of interests to ensure that AI can be a powerful catalyst for progress in our race to rescue the SDGs," she added.                   
                            UN member states adopted the 17 SDGs in 2015. Their aims include achieving food security, eliminating poverty, and providing access to clean and affordable energy by 2030.                   
                            During the July event, eight humanoid social robots and more than 20 specialized robots will be brought together under the same roof for the first time, the ITU s   
                            The humanoid robots—Beonmi, Nadine, Sophia, Geminoid, 4NE-1, Ai-Da Robot, Grace and Desdemona—will showcase capabilities ranging from fighting fires and delivering aid to providing healthcare and farming sustainably, it said.                   
                            At the event, government officials, industry executives, academics and UN agency heads are due to discuss the policies, regulations and standards needed for AI to help advance sustainable development.              
                            There will also be an "innovation factory", where start-ups from around the world can pitch their AI solutions for advancing the SDGs. </p>

                        <hr>
                        <p><br>OpenCV is an open source machine
                            learning software library aimed at face detection
                            based on a given dataset by the user. It captures
                            the face in both images and video streams in
                            accordance with certain sequential steps. We used
                            datasets consisting of three people, where one is
                            kept unknown for indicating faces of people we do
                            not knowand wish to label. With the assistance of
                            tree command we were able to obtain the directory
                            structure printed in our terminal. The project has
                            four pivotal directories in the root folder which is
                            responsible for face recognition by seeking
                            cumulative help from files in the root directory
                            which uses deep learning feature extractors in
                            order to generate 128-D vector describing a face.
                            Post extraction of embeddings from face data set
                            using extract_embeddings.py, we worked on
                            train_model.py script to train our linear Support
                            Vector Machine (SMV) model which helped in
                            face detection, extraction of embeddings and
                            fitting our SVM model into the embeddings data.
                            Along with recognizing static images, images in
                            the video stream could also be recognized using
                            recognize_video.py.
                            <br>AI assistant: We made the use of Google Assistant
                            API to create our own version of an assistant. It
                            worksin coherence with the features of our robot,
                            that is, it understands the voice commands given
                            by the user and generates a reply or any action
                            according to it. Using the Google Cloud Platform
                            to create the assistant was simple to comprehend
                            for someone inexperienced at creation of an
                            artificial intelligence.

                            with Re-speaker using the 40 pin GPIO. This stack was 
                            placedinside the hollow torso region created in our chassis in

                            that these robots could widely be used for medical assistance
                            and teaching aids thus making them an efficient social robots.
                            Their interactive ability causes them to become a great use in
                            therapeutic aid. These robots have been witnessed to have a

                            interactive skills it could be processed to perform a variety of
