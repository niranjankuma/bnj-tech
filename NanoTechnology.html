                             <br>Sometimes a distinction is made between nanotechnology and nanoscience, the latter
                                focusing on the observation and study of phenomena at the nanometre scale, and ways of
                                manipulating matter at that scale, at which many properties of matter differ from those familiar at
                                larger scales. The distinction is not of great importance, however: the nanotechnologist will
                                perforce have to observe, study and manipulate matter in the course of his or her work.
                                suggests a solid body of theory, upon which a technology could be built; such
                                theory is still inchoate, however, and the nanotechnologist is as likely to contribute to it as the
                                nanoscientist. In this essay the term nanotechnology will be used in an all-embracing sense

                            <hr>
                            <p>Metrology is intrinsic to manufacturing. Any serious manufacturing process must
                                incorporate the means to quantitatively assess the quality of the manufactured objects. This topic
                                is covered in depth elsewhere in this issue; for now it will suffice to mention one of the main tools
                                of the nanometrologist, the atomic force microscope (AFM), now one of the family of scanning
                                probe microscopes. The two essential components of an AFM are a needle capable of
                                responding sensitively to small declivities of a surface, and the means to scan that needle across
                                the surface. In typical realizations of the AFM, the needle is mounted on a flexible, highly
                                reflecting cantilever onto which a collimated beam of light is directed; if for example a small
                                bump is encountered, the needle will be pushed up, moving the cantilever and displacing the
                                beam reflected from it. Scanning is accomplished by applying minute voltages to a piezoelectric

                            <hr>
                            <p>
                                <br>Biology is considered to provide living proof of principle of nanotechnology. Biological
                                structures at macromolecular and supramolecular scales are apparently assembled using the
                                principles of self-assembly so eagerly sought by the nanotechnologist, and these structures, mostly
                                protein-based, often combine extraordinary lightness with extraordinary strength, and may be
                                miniature mechanisms of marvellous complexity. Two examples of amazing mechanical devices
                                are the so-called F1ATPase enzyme that uses a proton gradient across the membrane in which it is
                                embedded to synthesize that universal biological energy provider, adenosine triphosphate (ATP);
                                and the so-called type III secretion system (TTSS)—a spherical assembly of needles found on
                                the surface of certain pathogenic bacteria, and used to inject poison into their targets

                            <h3>Quantum mechanics</h3>
                            <p>
                                <br>Size is mostly a relative term, but quantum mechanics offers a definition of absolute
                                smallness: a system is absolutely small if it is perturbed by the act of observing it.5 Thus a photon
                                is usually destroyed by the act of observation, or its state is irretrievably altered. Most
                                nanosystems are not small enough for this to be the case. Nevertheless, quantum effects are
                                needed to understand certain nano-objects, for example the small clusters of atoms called
                                quantum dots, nanodots or nanoparticles. These objects are tiny spheres of a solid, typically a
                                semiconductor. In condensed matter, electrons are no longer the point particles they are
                                believed to be in free space, but have extension, quantified by their Bohr radius, which can vary
                                from a few to hundreds of nanometres, depending on the material. It is possible to make
                                nanoparticles smaller then the Bohr radius of electrons in them, thus the electrons are subjected
                                to quantum confinement, with the observable effect that the optical absorption and fluorescent
                                emission of the particle are shifted towards higher energies, the magnitude of the shift depending
                                on the particle size. Quantum effects must also be considered with ultraminiaturized electronic
                                circuitry—single electron devices.In summary, physics, chemistry and biology strongly overlap with nanoscience (defined as
                                the study of matter at the molecular scale), but differ essentially from nanotechnology, which
                                seeks to impose control over materials and devices at that scale. Quantum mechanics affects the
                                performance of devices at the lower end of the size range of nano-objects. Nanoscience and
                                nanotechnology could therefore be defined via the convergence of chemistry, biology, physics
                                and engineering. If one emphasizes this unity, it makes sense to refer to nanotechnology in the
                                singular; if one wishes to emphasize the diversity of applications, then it makes sense to refer to
                                nanotechnologies in the plural.
