                                AI can be broken down into two major fields, Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Networks (NN).
                                Both are subfields under Artificial Intelligence, and each one has its methods and algorithms to help solve problems.

                                What are the Different Types of AI? 
                                We have 4 types of AI:
                                <br><br>Reactive Machines 
                                <br><br>Limited Memory
                                <br><br>Theory of Mind. Self-aware 
                                <br><br>We classify AI mainly in terms of technology. 
                                <br><br>Here are the three types of AI-based on this classification Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) 
                                <br>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) 
                                <br>Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

                            <h3>LIMITED MEMORY</h3>
                            <hr>
                            <p>
                                <br><br>Limited memory machines are purely reactive machines with combined capabilities of learning from historical data for decisions making.
                                <br><br>In simple terms, limited memory has a small memory that they can use to make observations and judge a situation based on that, before giving a response.
                                <br><br>Today, these are one of the most stable and frequently seen types of AI. Almost all existing applications come under this category.
                                As I stated earlier, the one and only capability which distinguishes it from reactive machines are its ability to learn.
                                <br><br>Algorithms use previous knowledge to understand a situation and an appropriate reaction to it.
                                <br><br>Similar to all present-day AI systems, such as those using deep learning, they are trained by huge volumes of data that are store in their memory to form a reference model for problem-solving.
                                <br><br>For example, to teach image recognition AI name objects it scans, it is trained using thousands of pictures with their labels. Hence, while scanning an image, it uses the training images as references to understand the contents of the image. 
                                With time, it labels new images with increasing accuracy based on its learning experience.
                                The most common real-life example of this type of AI ranges from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving vehicles.

                            <h3>SELF AWARE</h3>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Self Aware is the state of AI that most technocrats are afraid of. But, currently, it is completely hypothetically.
                                <br> Self-aware AI, which is quite self-explanatory, is an AI that evolved to be so akin to the human brain and develops self-awareness.
                                <br>In simple, Self Aware AI system will have full access and understanding of its own. This type of AI will be an exact replica of human intelligence.                   
                                <br>This type of Ai is centuries away from materializing and will always be the ultimate objective of all AI research. But, if we successfully build this AI system, it would have its own needs and even beliefs.
                                <br>For instance, it might possibly have likes and dislikes and human-like qualities, like stubbornness.
                                <br>This is the type of AI you may have seen in sci-fi movies. As it has its own needs, beliefs, emotions, and potential desires, this is the type of AI that doomsayers of the technology are wary of.
                                <br>While the development of self-awareness can boost our progress by leaps and bounds, but it can also be potentially catastrophic.
                                <br>This is because self-aware AI is capable of having ideas such as self-preservation which may directly or indirectly spell the end for humanity.
